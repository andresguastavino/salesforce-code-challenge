## Challenge Requeriment

Universal Training Inc, a client of LaunchPadâ€™s, would like a Salesforce developer to enhance their reporting capabilities in regards to managing their training classes and attendees.

Types of training events may be recurring, and attendees can register for as many classes as they want, at any time leading up to the class. Invoices are automatically generated and emailed to attendees 48 hours prior to the class.
